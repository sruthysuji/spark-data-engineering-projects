Spark Data Engineering Projects

This repository contains a collection of hands-on projects and assignments completed as part of my Data Engineering training. The work is focused on understanding core big data concepts using tools like **Apache Spark**, **PySpark**, **Kafka**, **Airflow**, and **Spark Streaming**, executed in a Hadoop-Spark environment.

These projects simulate real-world data processing tasks such as batch and streaming analysis, SQL-based querying, and machine learning workflows using Spark MLlib.

Project List

1. Spark RDD Basics
- Explored **Resilient Distributed Datasets (RDD)** and their transformations/actions.
- Implemented map, filter, reduce, and flatMap operations on structured datasets.

2. Flight Data Analysis using Spark DataFrames
- Loaded and analyzed real-world flight performance data using **Spark DataFrames**.
- Performed data cleaning, aggregation, and delay pattern analysis.

3. Sales Data Analysis using PySpark SQL
- Connected structured CSV files and executed **SQL-style queries** using PySpark.
- Generated product, customer, and regional sales insights using joins and groupBy.

4. Word Count using Spark Streaming
- Simulated real-time streaming using socket input.
- Built a live **word count application** using Sparkâ€™s DStream API.

5. Trending Products using Kafka + Spark Streaming
- Integrated **Apache Kafka** with Spark to stream product event data.
- Filtered trending product names and performed transformations on live data.

6. Machine Learning with Spark MLlib
- Implemented basic classification and regression models using **Spark MLlib**.
- Explored Spark Pipelines and evaluated model performance.

Tools & Technologies

- Apache Spark (RDD, DataFrame, SQL, MLlib)
- Apache Kafka (basic producers/consumers)
- Spark Streaming
- Jupyter Notebook
- Python
- HDFS, Airflow(conceptual exposure)


About

These projects were developed in a virtual Hadoop-Spark cluster environment as part of a structured data engineering training program conducted by my college. Each notebook demonstrates hands-on skills in working with big data tools and concepts.
